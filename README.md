# ðŸ§  TensorFlow Image Classification Pipeline

This project implements a complete pipeline for image classification using TensorFlow. It includes dataset preparation, train-test-validation splitting, preprocessing (resizing, rescaling), and performance optimizations such as caching and prefetching.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Image dataset split into training, validation, and test sets
- Efficient input pipeline using `cache()`, `shuffle()`, and `prefetch()`
- Custom resizing and rescaling using `tf.keras.Sequential`
- Support for image augmentation and model training

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- TensorFlow Datasets (`tf.data`)
- Jupyter / Colab or any IDE
